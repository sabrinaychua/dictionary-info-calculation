# Making calculations on uncertainty and information search over words in English language

**Course**: Computational Cognitive Sciences Spring 2020

I had the opportunity to apply information theory concepts to calculate the smallest amount of information that will be conveyed in order to answer questions like: 
- Winning 20 Questions
- Information needed given the first character
- Information gain given the *first character*, *first vowel*, or *last character* of the word
- Whether English is an efficient code in Shanon sense

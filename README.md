**Course**: Computational Cognitive Sciences Spring 2020

I had the opportunity to apply information theory concepts to calculate the smallest amount of information that will be conveyed on a dictionary of English words in order to answer questions like:

- Information needed given the first character
- Information gain given the *first character*, *first vowel*, or *last character* of the word
- Whether English is an efficient code in Shanon sense
